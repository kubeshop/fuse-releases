## Usage

After downloading the CLI, you can start experimenting right away!

### Chat mode

To start a session in chat mode, simply run:

```shell
fuse
```

### Inline prompting

> [!TIP]
> When using inline mode, enclose your prompt in single quotation marks (') to prevent your shell from interpreting it.

Fuse CLI also supports inline mode, allowing you to execute prompts directly. Run:

```shell
fuse 'list files in the current directory and provide me better organization structure'
```
